This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Research Goals

 Explore Motor Trend dataset to fix a relationsship of automatic/manual gear and fuel usage in MilesPerGalon (MPG)
 
 Questions: 
  - Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG
  - MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions

## Executive Summary

## DataSet exploration  an

Data Set: mtcars
Detailed data description presented at Annex 1.

To answer this research question we interested in relationship of <mpg> (Miles Per Gallon) and <am> (Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual). We should include possible confounding variables to adjust independent relationship between <mpg> and <am> features. 

The main

## Modeling

### Model Selection criteria

### Residual Plots

### Coefficients interpretation

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Anex 1.

Description

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

Usage

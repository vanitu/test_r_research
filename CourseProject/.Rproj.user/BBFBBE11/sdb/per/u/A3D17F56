You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n```{r cars}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n## Research Goals\n\n Explore Motor Trend dataset to fix a relationsship of automatic/manual gear and fuel usage in MilesPerGalon (MPG)\n \n Questions: \n  - Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG\n  - MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n## DataSet exploration  an\n\nData Set: mtcars\nDetailed data description presented at Annex 1.\n\nTo answer this research question we interested in relationship of <mpg> (Miles Per Gallon) and <am> (Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual). We should include possible confounding variables to adjust independent relationship between <mpg> and <am> features. \n\nThe main \n\n```{r library(UsingR)}\n\n\n```\n\n## Modeling\n\n### Model Selection criteria\n\n### Residual Plots\n\n### Coefficients interpretation\n\n## Including Plots\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}\nplot(pressure)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n\n## Anex 1.\n\nDescription\n\nThe data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).\n\nUsage\n\nmtcars\nFormat\n\nA data frame with 32 observations on 11 variables.\n\n-\tmpg\tMiles/(US) gallon\n-\tcyl\tNumber of cylinders\n-\tdisp\tDisplacement (cu.in.)\n-\thp\tGross horsepower\n-\tdrat\tRear axle ratio\n-\twt\tWeight (1000 lbs)\n-\tqsec\t1/4 mile time\n- vs\tV/S\n-\tam\tTransmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)\n-\tgear\tNumber of forward gears\n-\tcarb\tNumber of carburetors\n",
